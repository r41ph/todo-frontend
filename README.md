Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

For the application to work you need to start the [TODO APP BACKEND](https://github.com/r41ph/todo-backend) at the same time.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />

### `npm build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />

### `Note:`

Please, note that for lack of time I haven't been able to implement:

- An .env file with any sensitive data needed as well as variables like the server URL for easy access through the code and manteinance.
- Better UI/UX with a error and updates messages management.
- Unit test for the components and their functionality.
